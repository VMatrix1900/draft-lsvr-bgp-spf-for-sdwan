              Usage of BGP-LS-SPF in Multi-segment SD-WAN
               draft-sheng-lsvr-bgp-spf-for-sdwan-latest

Abstract

   This document introduces the usage of BGP-LS-SPF protocol in multi-
   segment SD-WAN scenarios.  It allows SD-WAN tunnels to be published
   as logical links, which can cross the internet, MPLS networks, and
   various operator network.  The BGP-LS-SPF protocol can construct an
   overlay network topology for logical links and physical links across
   these heterogeneous networks, and calculate the reachability routes
   of overlay network nodes based on this topology.

1.  Introduction

   As pointed out in [I-D.draft-ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-problem-statement],
   enterprises are migrating their workloads to cloud service.  The
   enterprise branch interconnection and enterprise site to cloud DC
   connection may cross heterogeneous network such as operator networks,
   enterprise-owned backbone networks or direct connection lines.

   For large enterprises to access the cloud service and interconnect
   their branches, a PoP GWs network can be built to provide multi-
   cloud, multi-tenant, and multi-branch interconnection.  Depending on
   the geographical distribution of the enterprise branches, the PoP GWs
   network may be a cross-regional or even a global network.  The PoP GW
   can be connected to the operator network or the enterprise-owned
   backbone network.  The PoP GWs devices can also be directly connected
   through dedicated lines.

   According to [I-D.draft-ietf-bess-bgp-sdwan-usage], SD-WAN tunnels
   can be established between two GWs devices connected to the operator
   network, MPLS VPN network, or internet network through the WAN ports
   of the two PoP GWs devices.  All GWs are under the control of one BGP
   instance.  [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-sdwan-edge-discovery] defines the
   mechanism for SD-WAN edges to discover each other's properties via
   BGP update through RR.  This allows the interconnection between
   enterprise branches and multi-cloud to pass through multiple SD-WAN
   tunnels or direct connection lines, as shown in Figure 1.

   This draft provides a way to use the BGP-LS-SPF protocol to collect
   the identification of PoP GW device node and the topology of SD-WAN
   tunnel and direct connection lines.  In this way, each PoP GW device
   can learn the PoP GWs network topology, and calculate the route to
   any other PoP GW.

2.  Terminology

   This specification reuses terms defined in Section 5.2 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf] including BGP-LS-SPF Node NLRI, BGP-LS-
   SPF Link NLRI, Dijkstra Algorithm.

   *  PoP GW: Point of Presence Gateway

   *  SD-WAN: Software Defined Wide Area Network.  In this document,
      "SD-WAN" refers to policy-driven transporting IP packets over
      multiple different underlay networks to get better WAN bandwidth
      management, visibility and control.

   *  RR: Route Reflector

   *  Cloud DC: Off-Premise Data Centers that usually host applications
      and workload owned by different organizations or tenants.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

                       Figure 1: PoP GWs network

   As shown in Figure 1, GW1, GW2, GW5 are connected to the same
   internet/ISP network.  The GW2 and GW3 are connected through direct
   dedicated links.  GW5 and GW4 are connected by MPLS VPN.  BGP-SD-WAN
   neighbors are established between GWs through RR.  BGP-LS-SPF
   neighbors are established between each GW and RR.  SD-WAN tunnel
   links are established between GWs through BGP-SD-WAN neighbors
   reflecting SD-WAN routes(see
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-sdwan-edge-discovery]), as shown in the SD-WAN
   Tunnel between GW1 and GW2 with WAN port IP addresses of 10.1.1.1 and
   20.1.1.1, respectively.  GW nodes reflect the SD-WAN tunnel topology
   information to all GWs, including dedicated line-connected GWs,
   through BGP-LS-SPF neighbors with RR.

   GW2-GW3-GW4 are connected through dedicated lines.  BGP-LS-SPF
   neighbors are established between GWs through dedicated lines, and
   also between GWs and RR.  The BGP-LS-SPF neighbors between dedicated
   lines are used to discover the topology information of the dedicated
   lines, such as the direct link with port IP addresses of 30.1.1.1 and
   40.1.1.1 between GW3 and GW4 shown in the figure.  The dedicated line
   topology information is reflected to all GWs, including SD-WAN
   tunnel-connected GWs, through BGP-LS-SPF neighbors with RR.

   The BGP-LS-SPF LINK NLRI is used to carry the two endpoint IP address
   of the SD-WAN tunnel or dedicated lines.  The BGP-LS-SPF NODE NLRI is
   used to carry PoP GW device node identification.  They are advertised
   to other GWs through the RR.  In this way, all GW learns the topology
   of whole PoP GWs network and can calculate the next hop to any other
   GW using Dijkstra Algorithm.

4.  Extensions to BGP-LS

   The link could be Overlay link (Such as Internet, MPLS, LTE etc.,)
   and Underlay/Physical link (Such as Dedicated line, Direct link
   etc.,).  Different customer may require different types of link.  For
   example, FinTech customer has very high security requirement and
   would like to exclude Internet and LTE, only use MPLS or Dedicated
   line; some customer only wants to use the Dedicated line/Direct link
   to get the highest quality path; some customer prefers to use LTE
   only as backup link to save the cost.  The calculation of these
   customized SD-WAN path needs to include or exclude one or more
   specific link types, therefore, when SD-WAN link information is
   advertised through BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI, the SD-WAN link type needs
   to be explicitly indicated.

   In this document, a new BGP-LS-SPF Attribute TLV of the BGP-LS-SPF
   Link NLRI is added to identify a SD-WAN link type, called Link-Type
   TLV.  The format of the Link-Type TLV is defined as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              Type             |             Length            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |   Link-Type   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 2: Link-Type TLV Format

   where: Type: TBA

   Length: Specifies the length of the value field (i.e., not including
   Type and Length fields) in terms of octets.  The value MUST be 1.

   Link-Type:

   *  0: Reserved

   *  1: Physical/Dedicated Line/Direct link

   *  2: Internet

   *  3: MPLS

   *  4: LTE

   This BGP-LS-SPF Attribute TLV of the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is defined
   to indicate the Link-Type of the SD-WAN link.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations
